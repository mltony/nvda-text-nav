TextNav is  a new better way to navigate Internet for the blind. It allows you to quickly find readable content on almost any webpage on the Internet with just a single keystroke. Check out a short audio demo (7 minutes audio file):

More precisely, TextNav adds a keystroke to jump to next or previous text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more sentences, separated by periods. 
This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of a web page or to skip over menus, advertisements and other not important page elements.

TextNav was formerly a part of [SentenceNav](https://github.com/mltony/nvda-sentence-nav/) add-on.
