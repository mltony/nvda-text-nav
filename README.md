# Notice

TextNav add-on has been discontinued. TextNav functionality has been merged into NVDA core starting with version 2024.2. It is implemented as a quick navigation gesture and is  assigned by default to `p` and `shift+p`.

TextNav is  a new better way to navigate Internet for the blind. It allows you to quickly find readable content on almost any webpage on the Internet with just a single keystroke. Check out a short audio demo (7 minutes audio file):

More precisely, TextNav adds a keystroke to jump to next or previous text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more sentences, separated by periods. 
This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of a web page or to skip over menus, advertisements and other not important page elements.

TextNav was formerly a part of [SentenceNav](https://github.com/mltony/nvda-sentence-nav/) add-on.
## Keystrokes
* Alt+Shift+Down: Go to next text paragraph.
* Alt+Shift+Up: Go to previous text paragraph.
